# Gender_Detector
created a men vs women classification model using machine learning techniques, which accurately identifies and distinguishes between images of men and women. Additionally, developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a user-friendly way to interact with and utilize your classification model for real-world applications.
## To simply run this model:
1. Clone this repository
2. download the model from the drive link in the [model_download.txt](https://github.com/Himanshu-Atri/Men-VS-Women/blob/main/model_download.txt) file 
3. Run the [gui.py](https://github.com/Himanshu-Atri/Men-VS-Women/blob/main/gui_model.py) file
4. Upload the Image you want to detect
5. Click on detect button
6. View results
