# Men-VS-Women
I created a men vs women classification model using machine learning techniques, which accurately identifies and distinguishes between images of men and women. Additionally,  developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a user-friendly way to interact with and utilize your classification model for real-world applications.
